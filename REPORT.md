<br>While working on this challenge I started with a good speed.
<br>Setting all the basic data structures that I would be following and got to a basic layout of the ui
<br>on the first day.

<br>On the second day I started adding the basic functionality like loading from json and making the css
<br>look like how it is shown in the result.pdf.

<br>Then I started creating the unit tests before moving to the more generic functions like the
<br>calendar search component.

<br>But this was where i got stock for a while since i didn’t want to make a calendar from scratch,
<br>I used a library called Angular material that has something for this specific need but the problem
<br>was that they didn’t have what i needed by default so i started searching in stack overflow but i <br>couldn't find what i needed, after a while I decided to make my own combining what I found both <br>in the oficial page and in stack overflow getting what i wanted for the calendar finish.
<br>
<br>Then I moved to make more unit tests and tuned up what I had so far.And since I had most of the <br>features added I started making the ui that displays the selected email and allows you to open more <br>than one email at the same time like it was mentioned in the challenge.

<br>After I had that finished I started the final testing using some buttons that I created before to <br>increase the speed , then did some final css changes.

<br>At this point I would go through some more code refactoring but I wanted to put up my challenge <br>since when I saw the post it was posted 10 days ago and I really wanted to apply so I had to put an <br>end to it and upload it.

# I hope you take me in consideration. Thank you for your time and best regards!
