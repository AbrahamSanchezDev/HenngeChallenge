# Improvements

The tool itself is very clean and nice to look at , but think the user would like to have some
some the following features:

<ul>
<li>Search through writing in an input field.
<br>
The tool searches emails by selecting the date but i would add an input field to search by typing,
<br>
since there are times that the user would already know what he/she is looking for.
<li>Menu Panel.
<br>
Adding some menu panel where the user would be able to do simple actions like
<ul>
<li>Load all the emails.
<li>Clear the search.
<li>And some other usable simple actions.
</ul>
<li>Favorite option.
<br>
To be able to bookmark emails of interest.
<li>Categories
<br>
To be able to create custom categories and tag emails with them this would help organise the emails.
</ul>

I'm sure that there are cases that the client would need something more ,but that for the generic
<br>
use as mentioned in the challenge i think that the previously mentioned features would give
<br>
an improved experience to the client.
